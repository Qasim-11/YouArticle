Things we should add to the website : 

1 - In the header of the homepage,
    we need to add a feature so that the best articls our AI developed are shown in the left and the right of the header homepage,
    right below the list navigator icon, and below the other black icon in the top left corner, 
    from where should we take the articles that we will show in this section?
    that would be for the back-end devs to figure out,
    for now, we just need to find a way to display articles just like we discussed,
    I have created some samples in the "sample_articles" folder for you to test your implementation.

2 - Replace old images from my design to better images that are related to the project DONE

3 - Fill in the Eduthon section with some context DONE

4 - Fill in the Contact section DONE

5 - Fix up the [Video to Article / Video to Lab / Video to Quiz]

6 - Fix the text in the website because some of it is misleading,
for example, the Video to Quiz section is also named Video to Quizzes.

Optional :- 

7 - Choose better colours, for some reason I feel like the colours we chose are dead, maybe gradient stuff might fix up the problem

8 - Add stuff that might make the design better, I mean it's not bad but it's from 2022 :)

9 - Add a very simple video that explains how our model work.
